Yang Program

Overview

The Yang Program is a boundlessly recursive, infinitely extensible framework that seeks to unify all conceivable meta-structures of knowledge. This recursive structure progresses through levels of abstraction, namely meta, Meta, MEta, METa, and finally META, which represents the ultimate level of encapsulation. The Yang Program’s goal is to integrate and encapsulate all interdisciplinary and meta-interdisciplinary knowledge, positioning it as a universal recursive system.

Project Structure

This repository contains formalized definitions and recursive structures implemented in both Lean and Coq proof assistants. Each file corresponds to a different aspect of the Yang Program’s hierarchical meta-levels, including recursive structures, projective limits, and infinite encapsulations.

Files and Definitions

Below is an overview of the files in this repository and their contents:

	•	Define higher level Meta recursively.hs
Contains Haskell code to define the recursive structure for higher meta levels, such as Meta and MEta.

	•	Define the base recursive structure f.hs
Haskell code for defining the base recursive structure for meta, the starting level in the Yang Program’s hierarchy.

	•	General recursive structure definition
A document providing a general overview of recursive structures used throughout the Yang Program, applicable across all meta-levels.

	•	Lean example

Lean code illustrating an example of the Yang Program’s recursive structure using meta.
	•	Recursive limit as an infinite sequence

A document that describes how the recursive limit is implemented as an infinite sequence for each level, ultimately leading to META.
	•	Recursive structure for meta with a projective limit

Detailed explanation of the projective limit for meta, with formal definitions used in both Lean and Coq.
	•	inductive Meta / Type

Coq code for defining Meta as an inductive type, incorporating recursive elements and type definitions.
	•	inductive META / Type - 1

Coq file providing the inductive type for META, the ultimate level in the hierarchy, with type-level definitions.
	•	Inductive meta / Type /=

Coq code defining meta as an inductive type with a recursive structure that forms the base of the Yang Program.

Usage

To explore the Yang Program’s recursive structures, you can use the Lean and Coq files provided in this repository. If you are new to Lean or Coq, you may need to install these proof assistants. Here are the links:

	•	Lean Installation https://leanprover-community.github.io/get_started.html
	•	Coq Installation https://github.com/coq/coq/blob/master/INSTALL.md

Once installed, open the respective files in Lean or Coq to examine the formalized definitions.

Contributing

I welcome feedback, insights, and contributions from mathematicians, logicians, and interdisciplinary researchers. If you are interested in collaborating or providing feedback, please feel free to:

	•	Fork this repository and submit pull requests.
	•	Open issues with suggestions, questions, or insights related to the recursive structures.
	•	Contact me directly through GitHub or by emailing [your email here, if you’d like to include it].

Future Directions

The Yang Program is an evolving project, and future expansions will include:

	•	Further exploration of recursive limits and hierarchical encapsulation.
	•	Extensions of the program to integrate interdisciplinary knowledge structures.
	•	Potential applications in large cardinal theory, set theory, and other advanced mathematical domains.
